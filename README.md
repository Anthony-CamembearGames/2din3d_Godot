# 2D in 3D in Godot

Test of 2d Sprites in a 3D environement for Godot

The original tutorial can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flu2PNRUAso&ab_channel=AllenDevs

I believe I got most of the effects. For the shader he uses at the beginning I used the "Shaded flag" for 3D sprites.

He also mentions color grading at the end of the video, I set a Tonemap to filmic, not sure it's the same thing.

I also toned down the bloom as I do find it a little strong in his example.

The vignette effect is taken from : https://godotshaders.com/shader/player-vignette/

Hope you enjoy :)
